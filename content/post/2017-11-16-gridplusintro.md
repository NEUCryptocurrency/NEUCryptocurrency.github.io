# Problems grid+ seeks to solve
Grid+ has stated its goals as three-fold: it seeks to decentralise the energy market, to cut out middlemen in the sale of energy for the sake of reducing price, and to more intimately connect the production and demand for energy so that energy producers reduce the amount of generated energy that goes unused.

# How it does this
  - Grid+ first created a token with which consumers can directly purchase power from producers
  - Next, they created a smart device which does two things:
	-	- It tracks the price for energy throughout the day and buys when energy is cheapest
	-	- It buys energy on a consumer's behalf as the consumer's power usage is performed, directly notifying energy producers of demand
 - These tools should cut out middlemen, ie utilities, that put a markup on prices, should give energy producers they information they need to produce as consumers demand, and should allow a more secure and resistant system of energy distribution that does not rely on a single point of failure (ie, large utilities like National Grid)
